## Roblox Service Doc(s)

### CoreGui

- [ ] **Not Creatable** | You can't create an instance of this class with the **Instance.new** constructor.
- [ ] **Service** | This class is a top-level singleton. Retrive an instance of this class with the **GetService** function.
- [ ] **Not Replicated** | Roblox does not replicate this member across its server-client boundary.

The CoreGui is a service used to store
Guis created in-game by Roblox for the
core user interface found in every game
(such as the game menu, the playerlist, the backpack, etc.). It can also be used by
[`Plugins`](https://github.com/subnauticalaser/Project_With_RM/edit/main/README.md) in Roblox Studio.
